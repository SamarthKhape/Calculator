This repository contains multiple versions of calculator programs developed in Python, ranging from basic  operations to advanced implementations using functions and error handling. these projects were created to strengthen my Python programming fundamentals and logical building skills.

## Contents:
- Basic calculator with simple aritmetic operations.
- Calculator using functions for better code modularity.
- Calculator with error handling for robus inputs.

## Key Learnings: 
- User input handling.
- Function definition and usage
- Exception handling for invalid inputs.


*These projects are part of my Python learning journey and portfolio.*
